<div id='about'><p>Wee Chicks Fitness did not feel that their original website was suitable 
enough for what they needed at that point and didn’t feel it gave the best 
representation of their business, which consists of fitness classes and 
crèche sessions.</p></div>

  <div id='sectiontitle'> <h2 class="headertitle">Brief</h2></div>
        
        <div id='para'><p class='para'>I was asked to redesign their website 
to a standard comparable with other types of websites that are more common nowadays. Certain keywords 
they emphasized that were important to represent the site included fun & vibrant. They also required an onsite booking system so customers could order quantities of tickets for the fitness classes and also crèche sessions.</p></div>
        
          <div id='sectiontitle2'> <h2 class="headertitle">Process</h2></div>
        <div id='imager'></div>
<div id='leftpara'><p class='para'>We decided that a C.M.S. (Content Management System) would be the 
best way to go, and WordPress to be the ideal option. This way they 
would be able to edit the website much more easily and in less time. 
After meeting up a few times to discuss requirements and ideas, it was 
then time to research on websites of similar businesses – what they included, 
how they looked, the branding, and so on. WordPress templates, whilst they 
are meant to be easy to edit, the amount of flexibility in terms of how extravagant 
the site could look would be limited (depending on the theme you went with); 
this was in my mind when considering the site was required to have a fun and 
vibrant feel about it. As a booking system was an important factor to be included 
within the site. </p></div>
        <div id='leftpara'><p class='para'>I looked through a plethora of themes to see if they had one included.
I contacted various support teams of certain plugins for clarification and some other 
issues in order which theme would work best for the purpose of the website. Some of 
the responses included what I wanted to hear, and others not to be. I predominantly
 looked through two categories of theme: one based upon fitness, and another for 
children events. A challenge I came across was being able to blend the two together. 
What would the site represent the most? An issue Wee Chicks Fitness cover is wellbeing. 
Their aim is to help parents and kids keep healthy in terms of body and mind. 
This then brought up the task of how to go about implementing the colour scheme. 
For me it was always going to consist of the colours of the logo, which are red, blue 
and green.</p></div>
        
        <div id='imagel'></div>

<div id='leftpara'><p class='para'>This for me brought up another issue. How can I have the design of the website looking fun and vibrant (a site featuring crèche sessions) and also look appropriate for adults and parents (more mature). I found the target audience / colour scheme combination to be conflicting. I felt the use of the particular red and blue could feel untargeted towards a male audience, which taught me a key lesson. In regards to content, a key matter was the imagery. The website would have to contain imagery of the fitness classes and crèche sessions, as they are the main features of Wee Chicks Fitness, of course. 
</p></div>
        <div id='leftpara'><p class='para'>I found this to be a tricky issue, to get permission from parents to allow pictures on of their kids to be on the site. I let the client deal with that matter and any images they had the go ahead with I could then put them on the site. I found my process to consist of loops which I would research, create some rough drafts for the client to see, then research again, and create more drafts for them. It would come to the point where we would finally reach a satisfactory idea for the website to go ahead and produce.
</p></div>
        
                 <div id='sectiontitle3'> <h2 class="headertitle">Solution</h2></div>
        <div id='imager'></div>
<div id='para'><p class='para'>The final outcome would contain a modern look with a full screen design, allowing 
images to be presented throughout the pages. I decided to keep the use of the 
logo colour scheme to a minimum and keep the site predominantly white. I felt for 
smaller images having them circular would feel more appropriate than just having 
common square ones, they felt more ‘community’, ‘connecting’ and works better 
towards the target audience. I created the icons for the features section with the 
colour scheme to be the focal summary of what Wee Chicks Fitness entails.
 Header images on some pages would be less quality as a way of ‘privacy’ for the 
ones in the photographs, I can see arguments for both sides but I understand and 
respect that point of view. I kept most pages templated and simplistic for the 
content to be skimmed through easily. </p></div>
